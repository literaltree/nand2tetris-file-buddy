# How to use:

For inputs/outputs, type 'end' to move to the next step.

For the boolean expression, currently only 'and', 'not', 'or', 'mux', 'nand' are available.\n
'mux' and 'nand' must be typed like functions, with the following syntax:\n
    mux(a, b, sel)\n
    nand(a, b)\n
..while the already built-in ones ('and', 'not', 'or') can be used as normal.

When giving your .hdl filename, do not type the extension, and ensure that it is capitalised exactly how it is in your .hdl file.
